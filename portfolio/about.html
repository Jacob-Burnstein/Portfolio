      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Jacob Burnstein. I am a Software Developer who builds
        tools and systems that help people. I am also a professional musician,
        amateur home cook, and all-around hobbyist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before my shift into web development, I was VP of Day Services at a
        music-infused program that helps adults with intellectual disabilities
        build social, employment, and independence skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through strong leadership, analytical problem-solving, and adaptability,
        I provided resources and created sustainable systems to ensure my 70+
        clients and 30+ staff had tools for success.
      </p>
      <p>
        My creative affinity for building efficient tools drew me to writing
        code. Because I love working in methodical and incremental steps to
        achieve a greater goal, everything clicked when a close friend started
        teaching me the basics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only strengthened by my experience completing Fullstack Academy's web
        development bootcamp, I found assets in my transferrable skills that
        helped me to build my strong foundations in end-to-end software
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am excited by technologies that make a positive impact on the world,
        and collaborating with other developers who share those values.
      </p>
