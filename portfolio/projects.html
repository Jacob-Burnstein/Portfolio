                Executing all functions of a typical cash register, the Counter
                Amounter also breaks down change for the user, letting them
                incrementally add money received, and shows a step-by-step
                breakdown of change to return to the customer.

                Have you ever gone to make your morning coffee to then realize
                you don't have enough beans for your typical brew? How many
                grams do you have? Great, but how many cups of water should you
                pour in? It's 6am - too early for math.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is an application that solves this simple yet troubling
                problem of insufficient coffee for a full pot. I created this as
                a useful tool for my daily life and it has proven valuable for
                cooking, beer-making and of course, coffee!

                "From the very top of this EP, it seems like it should have been
                included in the soundtrack for a movie like Scott Pilgrim vs.
                the World. The opening track, “Pizzaface,” paints the perfect
                picture for what's to come throughout the five-track EP: Morin's
                pleasant vocals, a smooth flow and a catchy chorus to tie it all
                together." -

                “Automatic Sweetheart” starts off with quick and twangy
                minimalistic electric guitar work from Morin and melodic
                drumming that pops and bustles with the beat." -<a

              </a>
              <p>
                Midnight Snack asked me to join their group in 2013 and after
                recording this album, we toured up and down the east coast for 3
                months, camping and street-performing along the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this band, I got to experience life on the road with a band
                trying to make it, and gained valuable life experience with a
                close group of friends.
