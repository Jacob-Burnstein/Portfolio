                  This project was not only a means to challenge myself with
                  unfamiliar technologies but was also just an app I needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My wife and I used to use a shared Apple notes file which was
                  unreliably up-to-date, didn't provide a system to organize
                  lists by store, and lacked a UI built for in-store shopping.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I built this app to be user-friendly and intuitive, because
                  lists are lists, and don't need to be complicated.

                  Have you ever gone to make your morning coffee to then realize
                  you don't have enough beans for your typical brew? How many
                  grams do you have? Great, but how many cups of water should
                  you pour in? It's 6am - too early for math.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is an application that solves this simple yet troubling
                  problem of insufficient coffee for a full pot. I created this
                  as a useful tool for my daily life and it has proven valuable
                  for cooking, beer-making and of course, coffee!

                  EP: Morin's pleasant vocals, a smooth flow and a catchy chorus
                  to tie it all together." -

                  Midnight Snack asked me to join their group in 2013 and after

                  With this band, I got to experience life on the road with a

        <p>
          Before my shift into web development, I was VP of Day Services at a
          music-infused program that helps adults with intellectual disabilities
          build social, employment, and independence skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through strong leadership, analytical problem-solving, and
          adaptability, I provided resources and created sustainable systems to
          ensure my 70+ clients and 30+ staff had tools for success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I build web apps! My creative affinity for building tools drew me
          to writing code. Because I love working in methodical and incremental
          steps to achieve a greater goal, everything clicked when a close
          friend started teaching me the basics.
